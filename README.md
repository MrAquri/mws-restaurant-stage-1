# Restaurant Reviews Stage 1
---
Project for the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree with Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)

## Project Goal

The goal of the project was to convert **Restaurant Reviews** static webpage into a fully responsive on different sized displays webpage and accessible for a screen reader users. Also implementing service worker, allowing the application to work offline.

### Launching the application

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. If you would like to use Python to start a server follow instruction below:

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `py 3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
3. Enjoy the experience!
